## Using Shiny in the Classroom

. . .

First of all, why even??

. . .

Because you want your students to explore some data!

. . .

But why *Shiny*?

. . .

Because you want to maximize accessibility!

. . .

But *how* can I do this? I don't have a lot of time!

. . .

I've made Shiny dashboards for students before, and I want to gift you with a set of resources to get you started.

## Facilitating student learning

Not all of my students have a background in statistical programming (`experience != TRUE`)

. . .

I could have gotten my students trained up, but this would have:

. . .

-   eaten up precious class time âŒ›

. . .

-   led to unnecessary discouragement â˜¹

. . .

-   frustrated me ðŸ˜£

## Shiny as the solution

## Why Shiny?

. . .

There are tons of pre-existing dashboards out there already!

. . .

But is there a dashboard that already does exactly what you want it to do?

. . .

Does it have exactly the data you want your students to explore?

. . .

No?

. . .

Then Shiny can give you everything that you're looking for! ðŸ’ª

## What we'll do

. . .

&#10004; I'll have you download the code I used to create my 
**Shiny Data Explorer Template** 

. . .

&#10004; I'll walk you through the code so you can understand what it's doing

. . .

&#10004; I'll have us wrap up with an exercise where you update my code using a new dataset of your choice

## Before we get to it...

. . .

&#128552; You might be questioning whether you're "techy" enough to make this work.

. . .

&#128721; Don't! 

. . .

The process can be a little confusing at first

. . .

But you can do it!
