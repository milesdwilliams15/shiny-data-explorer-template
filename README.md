# Shiny Data Explorer Template

Get started making data explorer dashboards for your students using this Shiny template for RStudio. 

To run a local version of the application, all you need are the `app.R` script file and the `dashboard_data.csv` file.

You will also need the following packages installed:

- `shiny`
- `tidyverse`
- `here`
- `ggthemes`

Here's a link to the published template dashboard: https://milesdwilliams15.shinyapps.io/shiny-data-explorer-template/

Also, here's a link to a presentation I put together to talk about why you would want to use Shiny in the classroom: [Using Shiny in the Classroom](https://milesdwilliams15.quarto.pub/using-shiny-in-the-classroom/#/title-slide)
